The tests are arranged numerically to allow each Service Provider report the tests that are required and chose optional the tests that can be conducted in their individual networks and produce the optimum results.  The initial tests for each section are those that can be completed without interaction with other Service Providers.  The interaction progresses as the test progresses.  Matrixes for selected sections are furnished in Appendix E will also help define appropriate tests for each Service Provider.\r\r TOC o \"1-4\" \rSection 4	 GOTOBUTTON _Toc376675764   PAGEREF _Toc376675764 1\rTest Scripts	 GOTOBUTTON _Toc376675765   PAGEREF _Toc376675765 1\rSummary	 GOTOBUTTON _Toc376675766   PAGEREF _Toc376675766 2\r4.1  -  Pre-test and Setup	 GOTOBUTTON _Toc376675767   PAGEREF _Toc376675767 4\r4.1.1 - Preliminary Network Interconnection	 GOTOBUTTON _Toc376675768   PAGEREF _Toc376675768 5\r\r\r\r4.1  -  Pre-test and Setup\r\r\rThe purpose of the first test series is to establish a basis for communication between the Service Providers in the testing.  These tests should be conducted between all involved switches. \r\rStation equipment and basic connectivity is required during each phase of the testing for the purposes of initiating and terminating calls during the testing.
