# 2600 Index
This is the final production version source for William R. Epp's 2600 Index previously hosted at www.2600index.info and its mirror www.2600index.website, both of which are no longer live, nor maintained.  The code is not a mirror but a snapshop provided by William prior to commit here on GitHub. 

# Synopsis
In 2008 William R. Epp went live with the 2600 Index website, using PHP and SQL, to aid researchers and 2600 readers.  2600 magazine, the Hacker Quarterly, has been in print since 1984.  The publication has covered technical topics such as hacking, telephone switching systems, Internet protocols and services, as well as general news and letters from readers.  The 2600 Index aids users in identifying which 2600 issues specific authors, article titles and topics can be found in.  Additionally, the Index provided synopses, links and other useful information associated with each article.  The last issue covered by the 2600 Index was Volume 25, Number 3 (Autumn 2018).

# Plans
While the 2600 Index was live William provided the site code "Open Source" in the hopes folks would mirror 2600 Index and help keep the data available.  While no plans exist to maintain this snapshot and the dataset in the web form, a new Python project is underway that will provide the same services 2600 Index did, but in a local and self-contained format.  You can find that project here on GitHub: https://github.com/6368726973627279616e74/2600-Index-CLI
