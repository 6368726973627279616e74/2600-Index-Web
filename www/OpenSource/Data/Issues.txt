They are not isolated individuals, slaving away in a vacuum; hackers have established formal operations within every metropolitan city in North America. Hackers communicate via compromised Internet gateways, long-distance calls stolen from corporate victims and through about 1,300 underground bulletin boards across the U.S. This infrastructure collects and disburses a constant flow of stolen calling-card information, corporate voice-mail-access data, compromised PBX DISA-port numbers, hackable modems, cloned cellular telephones and cellular-phone IDs.... The threat to U.S. businesses also has recently taken a new direction, due to hackers' growing numbers and maturity. Security investigations have confirmed that known hackers are employed within Fortune 500 firms, which know nothing about the individuals' prior activities. The risk to U.S. bisinesses is clear: What will happen when one of these hacker's employment is terminated? Will the individual destroy or damage the company's voice/data networks, release vital information about these networks to other hackers, or plant the seeds of future destruction in company systems?
